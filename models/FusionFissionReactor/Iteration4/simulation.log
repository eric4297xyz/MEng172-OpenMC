ITERATION 4: EIGENVALUE DEPLETION - MEDIUM RESOLUTION
======================================================================

This simulation uses EIGENVALUE MODE for accurate depletion:
  - No external source - fission drives the reaction
  - Initial fissile: U-235 (0.35%), Pu-239 (0.26%)
  - Medium statistics: 1M particles per step (BALANCED)
  - Short time steps: 10 days for accurate tracking
  - Total simulation time: 30 days
  - Spent UO2 fuel: U-238 (30.8%), TRU, fission products

Building model...
Geometry: Fuel shell (r=50-100 cm) with inner Na coolant

Eigenvalue mode settings:
  Particles per batch: 10,000
  Inactive batches: 10
  Active batches: 40
  Total active particles: 4e+05
  Expected k-eff: ~0.4-0.6 (subcritical spent fuel)

ITERATION 4 EIGENVALUE DEPLETION COMPLETE
======================================================================
Quantitative depletion simulation complete. Results are in:
  results/iteration4_eigenvalue_highres/depletion_results.h5

Total simulation time: 7886.19 seconds
                       131.44 minutes
                       2.19 hours

✓ EIGENVALUE MODE - NO CORRECTION NEEDED
======================================================================
These results are quantitatively accurate and do NOT require
multiplication corrections. The eigenvalue solver properly handles
fission multiplication and normalization.

Expected results for subcritical spent fuel over 30 days:
  - k-eff: ~0.4-0.6 (subcritical)
  - Modest U-235 and Pu-239 depletion from fission
  - Small amount of Pu-239 production from U-238 capture
  - Gradual buildup of fission products
  - TRU transmutation (minimal net change over 30 days)
