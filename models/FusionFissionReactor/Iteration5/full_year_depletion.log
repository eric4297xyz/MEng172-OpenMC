FUSION-FISSION HYBRID: MANUAL DEPLETION
======================================================================

This simulation properly handles:
  - External D-D fusion source: 2.45 MeV @ 1e14 n/s
  - Fission multiplication in subcritical fuel
  - Accurate reaction rate normalization

Depletion: 4 steps × 90 days = 360 days
======================================================================

Building geometry...
Geometry: Fuel shell (r=50-100 cm) with inner Na coolant
Burnable material: spent UO2 (ID=1)
Initial volume: 3.6652e+06 cm³

Creating D-D fusion point source...

Transport settings:
  Particles per batch: 5,000
  Active batches: 20
  Total active particles: 100,000

Setting up reaction rate tallies...
Tallies created: fission, nu-fission, capture, (n,2n), (n,3n), flux
